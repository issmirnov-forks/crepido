## Setup

### Manual setup

1. Clone this repository  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/SrGMC/kanbana.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned repo directory  
   `$ cd kanbana`
3. Install dependencies  
   `$ npm install`
4. Start the server  
   `$ npm run`

A server will start at port 3000.  
You can change the port and cache time two ways:

-   CLI Arguments (takes priority)
    -   `-p <port>`
    -   `-c <cache time>` (in minutes).
-   Environment variables
    -   `PORT=<port>`
    -   `CACHE=<cache time>` (in minutes).

### Docker setup

#### `docker run`

```bash
docker run \
-p 3000:3000 \
-v "$PWD/boards:/usr/src/app/boards" \
-v "$PWD/images:/usr/src/app/images" \
-v "$PWD/labels.css:/usr/src/app/assets/labels.css" \
srgmc/kanbana
```

This command will start the container and mount `$PWD/boards` and `$PWD/images` inside it, so you can add images and boards. If you do not want to customize `labels.css`, remove `-v "$PWD/labels.css:/usr/src/app/assets/labels.css"` from the command.

#### Docker compose

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
    kanbana:
        environment:
            PORT: 3000      # Optional
            CACHE: 10       # Optional, in minutes
        image: srgmc/kanbana
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"   # If PORT is changed, this must be changed too
        volumes:
            - "/path/to/boards:/usr/src/app/boards"
            - "/path/to/images:/usr/src/app/images"
            - "/path/to/labels.css:/usr/src/app/assets/labels.css" # Optional
```

## Usage

### How to create boards

1. Create a file in the _./boards_ directory.
2. Add the following content:

```
---
"name": "Kanbana",
"picture": "none"
---

# Headers
* [UI] Labels
* [1h] Timers
* [25m] [UI] Labels and timers
* [ ] Uncompleted task
* [x] Completed task

# Markdown
* **Bold**
* *Italic*
* `code`
```

3. Acess your boards a `http://<server ip>:<port>/board/<board name>` or `http://<server ip>:<port>/board/<board name>.md`

Note:

1. Each heading followed by a list will be converted to a card.
2. You can create more than one board on the same page by duplicating the content above in the same file.

### Header images

Header images can be used in three ways:

1. `none`: Don't display any images
2. `/images/path-to-images.png`: Add images to the `images` directory and fetch them from Kanbana's server
3. `https://example.com/example.png`: Use an URL to fetch an external images


Example:
```html
<!-- No image -->
---
"name": "Kanbana",
"picture": "none"
---

<!-- Internal image -->
---
"name": "Kanbana",
"picture": "/images/image.png"
---

<!-- External image -->
---
"name": "Kanbana",
"picture": "https://example.com/example.png"
---
```

### Labels, timers and tasks

To add labels and timers, use:

```md
<!-- Labels -->
[Title] [labels]

<!-- Timers -->
[2d] 2 days
[3h] 3 hours
[30m] 30 minutes
```

Using tasks is easy too:

```
[ ] Uncompleted task
[x] Completed task
```

#### Custom labels

Labels can be customized using CSS

To create custom labels, edit `assets/labels.css`. A custom label follows this sintax: `.label--<label name>`.

For example, to create a _Help needed_ label with yellow color, create the class:

```css
.label--help-needed {
    background-color: #ffd43b;
    color: #000;
}
```

and use the label

```md
[help needed]
```
